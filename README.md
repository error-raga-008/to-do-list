# To-Do List Application

This is a Python-based To-Do List application built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to add, mark, and manage tasks easily.<br>
Features:<br><br>

Add a New Task: Users can enter a task and add it to their to-do list.<br>
Mark Task Done: Users can mark a task as done by selecting it from the list.<br>
Dynamic Task Management: The task list dynamically updates as tasks are added or completed.<br>
User-Friendly UI: A simple and intuitive interface, making it easy to interact with the app.<br>

Skills Gained:<br><br>

Python Programming: Gained hands-on experience with Python, understanding key concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and handling user input.<br><br>
Tkinter for GUI Development: Learned how to create interactive, visually appealing applications using Tkinter, including managing widgets such as buttons, labels, and text areas.<br><br>
Event Handling: Enhanced my understanding of event-driven programming through the use of button click events and managing user interactions.<br><br>
UI Design: Developed skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and organizing components in a way that improves the user experience.<br><br>
Debugging and Problem Solving: Worked through various challenges, such as handling empty input fields, updating the task list dynamically, and ensuring smooth functionality across different actions.<br><br>
Project Structuring: Gained experience in organizing a small project, using clear function definitions, and maintaining code readability and efficiency.<br><br><br>

This project helped me improve both my coding and problem-solving skills while also providing a good foundation in building GUI applications using Python.
